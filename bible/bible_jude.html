					<p>
                        Sept.9, 2022
                        <br><br>
                        Godâ€™s Grace demands a whole-life response.
                        <br><br>
                        The letter of Judas, albeit being a short epistle, brings one of the most important messages for all christians: Morality. Loving Jesus is not something superficial. It should be entrenched into our lives, with morality being the most important aspect. Committing sexual crimes and creating chaos within the church is ultimately spiritually detrimental to the church and its people. These who disobey Jesus and distort the good news will be accused. Living our lives based on the most holy faith, namely what Jesus has done for our sins, is the actual key to maintain faithfulness to the God. For christians, how you live is the most reliable indicator of what you actually believe. 
                        <br><br>
                        Amen.
                        <br><br>
                        "But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the holy spirit, keep yourselves up in the love of God, waiting for the mery of our lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life."
                        <br> -- Jude 1, 20-21
